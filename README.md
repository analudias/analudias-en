# My first README.md
Hi there, my name is Ana Lu√≠sa and I'm also known as Analu.

Currently, I'm studing [Java](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/) and [mobile development](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-completo-do-desenvolvedor-android/) with Udemy courses and enrolled on full-stack bootcamp development from [DevSuperior](https://www.linkedin.com/company/devsuperior/), that focus on Java, ReactJS and React-Native.

When I'm not coding, my hobbies are:
- Ride a bicycle
- Play video-games
  - First: Master-System
  - Current: PS4
- Watch tv-shows
  - Of all genres
  - Except horror
  - And musicals will always have a bigger place in my heart <3
