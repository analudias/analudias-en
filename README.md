# My first README.md
Hi there, my name is Ana Lu√≠sa and I'm also known as Analu.

My hobbies are:
- Ride a bicycle
- Play video-games
  - First: Master-System
  - Current: PS4
- Watch tv-shows
  - Of all genres
  - Except horror
  - And musicals will always have a bigger place in my heart <3

All of this happens when I'm not coding!
Currently, I'm studing [Java](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/) and [mobile development](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-completo-do-desenvolvedor-android/) with Udemy courses.
